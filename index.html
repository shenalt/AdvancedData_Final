                    Spills in the Bronx River weren’t all that surprising for Christian Murphy, the ecology and education manager at 
                    the Bronx River Alliance. After all, the program he was now in charge of at the BRA came about through a lawsuit 
                    against Con Edison, an energy company, over chemicals they had spilled in the river. <br><br>
                    
                    In his six years at BRA, he has had to deal with three separate spills into the Bronx River committed by Con Ed. 
                    The most recent one occurred in April 2024, when <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/bronx-river-oil-spill-con-edison/" target="_blank">1,000 gallons</a> of dielectric fluid leaked into the river and had 
                    only learned of it after being notified by partner organizations and not the source of the spill, ConEd.<br><br>

                    “There were about five or six catchbooms in each location so it would’ve prevented anyone from doing any 
                    recreational activities,” said Murphy. “We had residents wondering what was happening and why the river looked 
                    like that.”<br><br>

                    Storms immediately after the spill helped flush out the chemicals from the river alongside the cleanup crew but 
                    spilling foreign substances in New York state is not exactly a new occurrence for ConEd.<br><br>

                    Since 1984, Con Ed has been responsible for 3,854 spills of various chemicals and other fluids in New York state. 
                    Since 2000, they have averaged around 138 spills a year in the state. Most spills have been relatively small, with 
                    the majority having unrecovered amounts of spilled material or fluid totaling less than 100 gallons onto New York 
                    lands or waterways.<br><br>

                    <iframe title="Number of Spill Incidents by ConEdison in New York" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-iP3ig" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/iP3ig/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="400" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";r.style.height=d}}}))}();
                    </script>

                    However, for the 8% of spills that have been greater than or equal to 100 unrecovered gallons, they have begun to 
                    ramp up in frequency beginning around the late 2000’s. Spills of dielectric fluid and other materials have reached 
                    double digits every year consecutively since 2009. This year is on pace to continue the troubling trend.<br><br>

                    Dielectric fluid, which makes up roughly 68% of all substances spilled by Con Ed in New York, is an insulating liquid 
                    used to prevent and suppress electric discharges in high voltage applications such as transformers, capacitors or 
                    cables. It comes in four main types: mineral, synthetic, silicone and ester based fluids.<br><br>

                    ConEd utilizes mineral-based dielectric fluid for their equipment which is non biodegradable and flammable. However, 
                    dielectric fluid in general has very low aquatic toxicity and is easier to clean up than petroleum. Because of this, 
                    it is not considered harmful to most aquatic wildlife and plants but does coat and smother the feathers of waterfowls 
                    such as ducks and geese which can induce hypothermia. It can also result in “contamination of soil and groundwater” 
                    according to Dennis Slattery, spokesperson for the New York State Department of Conservation.<br><br>

                    When it comes to non biodegradable materials such as mineral-based dielectric fluid, a proper clean up is crucial for 
                    the environment’s health and well-being as a disruption in one part of an ecosystem has reverberating effects across 
                    the entirety of it.<br><br>

                    When an incident does happen, ConEd is held entirely financially responsible for the cleanup which it usually 
                    outsources to a third party contractor. In the past, the New York based energy company has had to pay civil penalties 
                    for large spills. In May 2017, a 30,000 gallon spill of dielectric fluid into the East River led to financial 
                    compensation.<br><br>

                    The price to pay for such contamination? <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6986176-Consent-Order/" target="_blank">$550,000</a>.<br><br>

                    That amount made up approximately .03% of ConEd’s net income in 2024 which totalled <a href="https://www.coned.com/en/about-us/media-center/news/2025/02-20/con-edison-reports-2024-earnings" target="_blank">$1.82 billion</a>. In decades past, 
                    ConEd paid significantly more for contamination. In 1994, they paid <a href="https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA174489620&sid=sitemap&v=2.1&it=r&p=AONE&sw=w&userGroupName=nysl_oweb&isGeoAuthType=true&aty=geo" target="_blank">$9 million</a> in fines, which is equivalent to 
                    around $19 million in today’s dollars. That would have covered around 1% of their most recent yearly net 
                    income.<br><br>

                    In the 1994 case, the ConEd chairman at the time, Eugene R. McGrath, cited equipment failure for the main reason as 
                    to why they were caught illegally dumping industrial waste into the New York Harbor. Historically, equipment failure 
                    is the number one contributing factor leading to spills committed by the company as it makes up 61% of all reasons 
                    for spills by ConEd in the state.<br><br>

                    All but two of the ten largest spills courtesy of ConEd were due to equipment failures and half were dielectric 
                    fluid, adding up to 102,205 gallons spilled in total. Six of the largest ten occurred on or after 2009.<br><br>

                    ConEd has spilled chemicals in the state so often the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation has a 
                    Memorandum of Understanding with the company which outlines procedures for spills and cleanups for impacted areas. 
                    The DEC also regularly meets with Con Ed to discuss currently open spill cases and ensure the private energy company 
                    meets the standards set by the department.<br><br>

                    Despite these efforts, spill incidents from Con Edison have not improved.<br><br> 

                    “The overarching problem is that the New York City electric infrastructure system is very very old and it’s 
                    incredibly complicated,” Walter Hang said, head of the Environmental Health Research Group, an environmental 
                    research and advocacy group in New York.<br><br>

                    Collateral damage coming from spilled substances has simply become the cost of doing business for the energy company, 
                    and thus has not improved the root issue of a deteriorating infrastructure argues Hang.<br><br>

                    New York State Assemblymember Nader Sayegh of Yonkers, one of the parts of New York hardest hit by ConEd spills gave 
                    a statement regarding the incidents.<br><br>

                    <iframe title="Dielectric Fluid Sills by ConEd Past Five Years" aria-label="Locator map" id="datawrapper-chart-6lOCx" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/6lOCx/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="690" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
                    </script>

                    “Con Edison's continued disregard for ongoing issues with its electric feeder cables leaking dielectric fluid, is 
                    both outrageous and insulting,” Sayegh said in an email to New York City News Service. “I am joining efforts to 
                    demand that Con Edison take precautionary measures to safeguard us from any further hazards.”<br><br>

                    As of now however, statements and demands have been the only action item thus far, with no major legislation addressing 
                    the leaky electrical infrastructure.<br><br>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>
                        I retrieved my data from the The <a href="https://data.ny.gov/Energy-Environment/Spill-Incidents/u44d-k5fk/about_data" target="_blank">New York State Open Data site</a>, specifically pulling from the Spills 
                        Incidents Database maintained by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. I 
                        originally came up with the idea for this story parsing through the data and looking at the largest 
                        spills in the state. It caught my eye that some were committed by ConEdison. After an initial 
                        filtering for ConEdison, I came across interesting findings.<br><br> 

                        I read in two different dataframes because I noticed that as time passed and I downloaded a more up 
                        to date version of the data, the ‘Project Facility Name’ for some entries that initially had ‘ConEd’ 
                        or ‘Con Ed’ attached to them were removed. Thus, when I filtered for ‘ConEd’ entries, they were not 
                        included. So, I kept the first dataset I had pulled from the site and used it as a baseline to make 
                        sure all of the initial entries I had seen were still there when I introduced the updated data and 
                        filtered for ConEd.<br><br> 

                        When cleaning the data, I first removed the entries that had an empty ‘Project Facility Name’ field. 
                        I then made sure there were no duplicates in the dataset. I then created a separate Year field based 
                        on the ‘Spill Date’ column to make the data more filterable along the year field.<br><br> 

                        I then created a simple function to calculate the unrecovered amount of gallons or pounds of a spilled 
                        material. The dataset provided the spilled amount and the recovered amount so I simply took the spilled 
                        amount and subtracted it by the recovered amount to retrieve the unrecovered amount. In my analysis, I 
                        only referred to the unrecovered amount.<br><br> 

                        I then filtered the data to only show spills committed by ConEdison. To do that, I simply filtered the 
                        data to show entries that contained the string ‘CONED’ or ‘CON ED’. I did that for both dataframes and 
                        then merged the two using their corresponding spill numbers.<br><br> 

                        I arbitrarily filtered the data further to show entries that only had unrecovered amounts of material 
                        that equalled or exceeded 100 gallons or pounds. There was a lot of entries with small spills and 
                        decided 100 was a good jumping off point to assess larger-scale spills.<br><br> 

                        My analysis then included using .value_counts(normalize=True) to see the percentages of categories 
                        such as ‘Contributing Factor’ and ‘Material Family’.<br><br>
